# Calqlator
This is a webapp designed to help calculate grades. It is able to parse data from quercus to provide a course grade calculator in a user-friendly manner. (https://calqlator.web.app/)
My first time using react (and javascript for the most part) so please do make changes where you think its necessary.
Potential additions:
  - Animations
  - Section handling (ability to organize assignments into sections and what not)
  - Nicer ui (for example adding html is very ugly)
